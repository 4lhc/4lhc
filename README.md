- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sreejith Sasidharan
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a researcher at Amrita University, India. My primary research interests lie in long-term human-robot interaction (HRI)for positive behavioural change.
More precisely, I would like to explore the underlying social mechanisms for long-term HRI with social robots 
as motivational agents and develop computational algorithms to implement these mechanisms.
